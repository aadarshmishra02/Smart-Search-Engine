But here’s the thing - most people want to write, but just can’t get past the initial challenges. This might sound familiar to a lot of people:

What should I write about?
Will anyone read my article?
How do I make my article stand out?
Should I even write?


If you’ve ever asked yourself these questions, you’ll find the answers in this free crash course on how to write impactful and awesome data science articles! Why did we create this course?

While a lot of folks know about these tools (having used them for cloning open source code from Google Research and other top data science organizations), they never really understand their real purpose.
The beauty of version control will be akin to a revelation. The way you can create a remote project and have all your team members work on different features parallelly yet independently but still have a stable running code at the end of the day - priceless!

Getting started with Decision Trees,"What is a Decision Tree?
A Decision Tree is a flowchart like structure, where each node represents a decision, each branch represents an outcome of the decision, and each terminal node provides a prediction / label.

Why learn about Decision Trees?

Decision Trees are the most widely and commonly used machine learning algorithms.
Decision Trees can be used for solving both classification as well as regression problems.
Decision Trees are robust to Outliers, so if you have Outliers in your data - you can still build Decision Tree models without worrying about impact of Outliers on your model.
Decision Trees are easy to interpret and hence have multiple applications in different industries.","Introduction to Decision Tree

Twitter Sentiment Analysis,"What is Sentiment Analysis?

Sentiment Analysis or Opinion Mining is a technique used to analyse the emotion in a text. We can extract the attitude or the opinion of a piece of text and get insights on it. 
In the context of machine learning, you can think of Sentiment Analysis as a Classification problem where the text can either have a positive sentiment, a negative sentiment or a neutral one.


What are the applications of Sentiment Analysis in the industry?

In the age of social media, it is extremely common to comment about 
a movie you liked or 
a book you didn’t like or 
a product you bought was not up to the mark.


Therefore, a lot of companies use sentiment analysis for their products since it provides direct feedback of the customer’s opinion.
It is also important to detect and remove hateful content from social media and companies like Twitter, Facebook, etc. extensively use sentiment analysis on a daily basis.

 
On what kind of projects would I implement sentiment analysis?
There are a wide variety of projects where you can use Sentiment Analysis. Here are a couple of popular use cases:

Sentiment Analysis can not only be used for customer reviews or product feedback, but in other domains as well.
Analyzing the sentiments on social media on the US Elections, for example, gives useful insights on which candidates are favoured by the public and which are not.

For other interesting problems involving sentiment/emotion detection, you can visit: https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/all/

What is the range of sentiments that can be observed and analysed?

In the earlier days of Natural language processing and Sentiment Analysis, the sentiments could hold only 2 or 3 values: Positive or Negative, and Positive, Neutral or Negative.
However, with the advent of deep learning, we can now recognize the subtle emotions in a text as well.
This has made tasks like Sarcasm detection, fake news detection etc. popular in research areas of Natural language processing 


Can I add this project to my resume and use it in my Interview?

Sentiment Analysis is one of the most popular applications of Machine Learning and Classification in Natural language processing
We also encourage you to take up more diverse datasets and apply sentiment analysis on them.

Evaluation Metrics for Machine Learning Models,"Evaluation metrics form the backbone of improving your machine learning model. Without these evaluation metrics, we would be lost in a sea of machine learning model scores - unable to understand which model is performing well.
 
Wondering where evaluation metrics fit in? Here’s how the typical machine learning model building process works:

We build a machine learning model (both regression and classification included)
Get feedback from the evaluation metric(s)
Make improvements to the model
Use the evaluation metric to gauge the model’s performance, and
Continue until you achieve a desirable accuracy

 
Evaluation metrics, essentially, explain the performance of a machine learning model. An important aspect of evaluation metrics is their capability to discriminate among model results.

That’s a key reason why data scientists are expected to be familiar with web scraping.
We have found web scraping to be a very helpful technique for gathering data from multiple websites. Some websites these days also provide APIs for many different types of data you might want to use, such as Tweets or LinkedIn posts.
But there might be occasions when you need to collect data from a website that does not provide a specific API. This is where having the ability to perform web scraping comes in handy. As a data scientist, you can code a simple Python script and extract the data you’re looking for.
So knowing how to perform web scraping using Python will help you go a long way towards becoming a resourceful data scientist. Are you ready to take the next step and dive in?
A note of caution here – web scraping is subject to a lot of guidelines and rules. Not every website allows the user to scrape content so there are certain legal restrictions at play. Always ensure you read the website’s terms and conditions on web scraping before you attempt to do it.
In this course, we will dive into the basics of web scraping using Python. We will understand what web scraping is, the different Python libraries for performing web scraping, and finally we’ll implement web scraping using Python in a real-world project.

Learn how neural networks work in deep learning
Do you want to acquire a super power? How about learning neural networks? Neural networks are at the heart of the deep learning revolution that’s happening around us right now.
Neural networks are the present and the future. The different neural network architectures like convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), and others have altered the deep learning landscape.
But as a beginner in this field, you’ll have a ton of questions:

What is a neural network?
Why do we need to learn neural networks?
How popular are neural networks?
What are the advantages of neural networks?
What kind of challenges you could face when applying neural networks?
What exactly should you learn about neural networks?
What are the core concepts that make up neural networks?
What are the different types of neural networks in deep learning?
Do you need to know programming to build a neural network?
Which programming language is best for building neural networks? Python or R?
What are the different applications of neural networks?
What kind of problems or projects can you solve using neural networks?


From classifying images and translating languages to building a self-driving car, neural networks are powering the world around us. Thanks to the idea of neural networks like CNN and RNN, deep learning has penetrated into multiple and diverse industries, and it continues to break new ground on an almost weekly basis!

Hypothesis Testing for Data Science and Analytics,"Statistics is the study of the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organisation of data. For all the data science and machine learning enthusiasts it is paramount to be well versed with various statistical concepts such as Hypothesis testing
Every day we find ourselves testing new ideas, finding the fastest route to the office, the quickest way to finish our work, or simply finding a better way to do something we love. The critical question, then, is whether our idea is significantly better than what we tried previously.
These ideas that we come up with on such a regular basis – that’s essentially what a hypothesis is. And testing these ideas to figure out which one works and which one is best left behind, is called hypothesis testing.","Introduction to Hypothesis Testing Course
